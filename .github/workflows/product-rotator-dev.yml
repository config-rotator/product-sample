          # The assumprtion being that these reps have already built either packages or images, 
          # following a naming convention that you know â€” which includes the SHA
          # and pushed them to a registry or artefact repository you know about
          # where you can now pull them from
          # ... and do your thing!

          # An example could be:
          # If you have an IaC stack repo with a Pulumi or Terraform stack that you want to deploy to a dev environment,
          # you can use the SHAs of imaginary Backend and Frontend images to pull
          # You configuration file should then mention
          # - the IaC stack repo
          # - the Frontend repo
          # - the Backend repo
          # now, if any of the repos change, the the rotator will be triggered - and eventially you will end up here.
